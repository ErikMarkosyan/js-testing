/* Logical operators
There are three logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT).

Although they are called "logical", they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. 
Their result can also be of any type.

Let’s see the details.

|| (OR)
The "OR" operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:

let result = a || b;
In classical programming, the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. 
If any of its arguments are true, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.

In JavaScript, the operator is a little bit trickier and more powerful. 
But first, let’s see what happens with boolean values.

There are four possible logical combinations:

console.log( true || true );   // true
console.log( false || true );  // true
console.log( true || false );  // true
console.log( false || false ); // false
As we can see, the result is always true except for the case when both operands are false.

If an operand is not a boolean, it’s converted to a boolean for the evaluation.

For instance, the number 1 is treated as true, the number 0 as false:

if (1 || 0) { // works just like if( true || false )
  console.log( 'truthy!' );
}
Most of the time, OR || is used in an if statement to test if any of the given conditions is true.

For example:

let hour = 9;

if (hour < 10 || hour > 18) {
  console.log( 'The office is closed.' );
}
We can pass more conditions:

let hour = 12;
let isWeekend = true;

if (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {
  console.log( 'The office is closed.' ); // it is the weekend
}
OR "||" finds the first truthy value
The logic described above is somewhat classical. Now, let’s bring in the "extra" features of JavaScript.

The extended algorithm works as follows.

Given multiple OR’ed values:

let result = value1 || value2 || value3;
The OR || operator does the following:

Evaluates operands from left to right.
For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, 
stops and returns the original value of that operand.
If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.
A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.

In other words, a chain of OR "||" returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.

For instance:

console.log( 1 || 0 ); // 1 (1 is truthy)
console.log( true || 'no matter what' ); // (true is truthy)

console.log( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
console.log( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)
console.log( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)
This leads to some interesting usage compared to a "pure, classical, boolean-only OR".

&& (AND)
The AND operator is represented with two ampersands &&:

let result = a && b;
In classical programming, AND returns true if both operands are truthy and false otherwise:

console.log( true && true );   // true
console.log( false && true );  // false
console.log( true && false );  // false
console.log( false && false ); // false
An example with if:

let hour = 12;
let minute = 30;

if (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {
  console.log( 'The time is 12:30' );
}
Just as with OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND:

if (1 && 0) { // evaluated as true && false
  console.log( "won't work, because the result is falsy" );
}
AND "&&" finds the first falsy value
Given multiple AND’ed values:

let result = value1 && value2 && value3;
The AND && operator does the following:

Evaluates operands from left to right.
For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is false, 
stops and returns the original value of that operand.
If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.
In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.

Precedence of AND && is higher than OR || Just like OR, the AND && operator can sometimes replace if.

let x = 1;

(x > 0) && console.log( 'Greater than zero!' );
! (NOT)
The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign !.

The syntax is pretty simple:

let result = !value;
The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

Converts the operand to boolean type: true/false.
Returns the inverse value.
For instance:

console.log( !true ); // false
console.log( !0 ); // true
A double NOT !! is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type:

console.log( !!"non-empty string" ); // true
console.log( !!null ); // false
That is, the first NOT converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse, 
and the second NOT inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.

console.log( Boolean("non-empty string") ); // true
console.log( Boolean(null) ); // false
The precedence of NOT ! is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes first, before && or ||.
